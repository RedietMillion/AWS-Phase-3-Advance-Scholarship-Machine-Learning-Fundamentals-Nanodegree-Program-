# AWS-Phase-3-Advance-Scholarship-Machine-Learning-Fundamentals-Nanodegree-Program-
I recently completed the advanced Nano-degree program "Machine Learning Fundamentals" through the AWS AI & ML Scholarship Program by Udacity. Out of thousands of applicants, I was chosen as one of the top 500 candidates worldwide for this second Scholarship course. I successfully finished four ML projects, including predicting bike sharing demand, developing a handwritten digits classifier, landmark classification for social media, and building an ML workflow for Scones Unlimited on Amazon SageMaker. I'm grateful to AWS, Udacity, session leads, and community moderators for their support and encouragement. Learning is a never-ending process!
